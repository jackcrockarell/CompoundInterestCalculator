# Compound Interest Calculator 

## Overview
This Python program calculates the amount of money accrued over time using **compound interest**. The user inputs the **initial principal**, **interest rate**, and **time period**, and the program computes the final balance.

---

##  Formula Used
The program uses the compound interest formula:

\[
A = P * (1 + (r / 100))^t
\]

Where:
- **A** = Final balance  
- **P** = Principal (initial amount)  
- **r** = Interest rate (percentage per year)  
- **t** = Time (in years)
